    <p class="bookContent">
        After winning the lottery, Old MacDonald decides to sell up his farm and buy a zoo 
        with his winnings - but what will the old farm animals make of this? 
        With liftable flaps adding extra interaction to this brilliant twist on 
        a well-known tale, the book hilariously reveals how the zoo animals 
        picked off the farm animals one by one. From the talented mind of 
        Curtis Jobling and the amazing illustrator Tom McLaughlin, this is 
        a laugh-out-loud book for child and parent.
